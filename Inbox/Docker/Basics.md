Here write a text that goes depth into these next 2 questions/answers:

- Whats docker?
		Docker is a container technology, meaning that we can create and manage containers
- What's a container?
		 A standardize piece of software that contains the code AND the dependencies to run that code (e.g. C# code + dotnet sdk 8.0), meaning that the same container always yields the same application and execution behavior.

Here write a text that touches every question next:

Why containers?
What are the benefits?
Why would we want independent, standardized application packages?
Maybe here you can add examples of working with different environments maybe?

Containers vs Virtual machines


Here, write a text comparing both technologies, and then maybe add a list of pros and cons of each technology or something

Natural numbers: represent the set of positive integer numbers starting at 1 that have no fractional part. 
Examples: 1,2,3,4,5

Whole numbers: The set of all natural numbers and 0.
Examples: 0,1,2,3,4

Integers: The set of all whole numbers including negative numbers
-2,-1,0,1,3

Rational numbers: The set of all numbers that can be written by dividing one integer by another. 
Note: You cannot have a 0 in the denominator of a fraction.
Examples: 1/2 (which equals -1/-2), 0.3333... (which equals 1/3), -8 (which equals -8/1 or 8/-1).

Natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are all rational numbers.

Irrational numbers: These are the numbers that cannot be represented by diving one integer by another, when these numbers are written as decimals, it goes forever without repeating itself.
Examples:squared root of 5, 0.25, 0.34715...

Real numbers: The set of all numbers on a number line. So, all rational and irrational numbers.
Examples: 8, -19, 0, 3/2, squared root of 25, x,...

Important points about decimals:
Terminating decimals: Are decimals that have an end and no repeating number or group of numbers. These decimals are rational numbers.
Example: 0.25 <-- this decimal ends.

Repeating decimals: These decimals go on infinitely but one or more numbers repeat themselves. These are irrational numbers.
Examples: 1/3 (0.333333...) or 9/7 (1.285714285714...).

Variables have scope, a variable is accessible inside the block (and nested blocks inside) where it was defined

VAriables get always inmediately dropped when they go out of scoped (no garbage collector like C#? GPT, please go deeper here...)

VAriables can get shadow in Rust, GPT, here please go deeper with code examples....

Vsriables can also get shadow in the same scope, in some way, GPT please go deeper with code examples and a scnario where this could be benefitial...

Variables can also get shadow by different types, GPT, please add a code examble for this and go deeper in pros and cos

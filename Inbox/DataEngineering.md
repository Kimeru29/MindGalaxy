The data engineer work with multiple typews of data to perform many operations.

**Types of data:**

**Structured**: Structured data comes from table-based sources (SQL, CSV, etc), so they're composed of rows and columns.
**Semi structured**: Semi structured data have a structure that may require flattening/transformation prior to loading into a source system, such as JSON.
**Unstructured**: Unstructured data includes data stored as key-value pairs that don't adhere to any standard relational models or other types, blobs fall in this category.

**Data operations**

**Data Integration**: This refers to the ability to establish connections between different data-sources and operational/analytical services for business processes.
**Data Transformation**: The process in which the data can be converted between formats, often because a data source is expecting data in a different format or to fulfill business rules (think ETL software like SSIS).
**Data Consolidation**: It's the process of combining data from multiple sources into a consistent data structure, usually to support analytics and reporting. Commonly the data is extracted, transformed and then loaded into a data lake or data warehouse.

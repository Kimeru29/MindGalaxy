## 1️⃣ Natural Numbers (ℕ)

Natural numbers represent the set of positive integer numbers starting at 1 that have no fractional part. 
Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## 2️⃣ Whole Numbers (ℤ₀)

Whole numbers are the set of all natural numbers and 0. 
Examples: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

## 3️⃣ Integers (ℤ)

Integers are the set of all whole numbers, including negative numbers ↕️. Examples: -2, -1, 0, 1, 3

## 4️⃣ Rational Numbers (ℚ)

Rational numbers are the set of all numbers that can be written by dividing one integer by another. _Note: You cannot have a 0 in the denominator of a fraction. 
Note: Natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are all rational numbers._

Examples: $\frac{1}{2}$ (which equals $\frac{-1}{-2}$), 0.3333... (which equals $\frac{1}{3}$), -8 (which equals $\frac{-8}{1}$ or $\frac{8}{-1}$)

## 5️⃣ Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers are the numbers that cannot be represented by dividing one integer by another. When these numbers are written as decimals, they go on forever without repeating themselves. 
Examples: √5, π, e, 0.34715...

## 6️⃣ Real Numbers (ℝ)

Real numbers are the set of all numbers on a number line. So, all rational and irrational numbers. 
Examples: 8, -19, 0, $\frac{3}{2}$, √25, x,...

## 🔍 Important Points About Decimals

-   **Terminating Decimals**: Decimals that have an end and no repeating number or group of numbers. These decimals are rational numbers. 
Example: 0.25
-   **Repeating Decimals**: Decimals that go on infinitely, but one or more numbers repeat themselves. These decimals are also rational numbers. 
Examples: $\frac{1}{3}$ (0.333333...) or $\frac{9}{7}$ (1.285714285714...).

## 🌟 Introduction

### ✨ What is the Basic Structure of an HTML Document?

The basic structure of an HTML document forms the foundation of any web page. Understanding this structure is crucial to creating valid and well-organized web documents that browsers can interpret correctly.

## 🛠️ <!DOCTYPE html> Declaration

### 🔍 What is `<!DOCTYPE html>`?

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is the first line in any HTML document. It tells the web browser what version of HTML the document is using, which ensures that the browser will render the page in standards mode.

```html
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
```
This simple declaration is used in HTML5 and ensures that the document is parsed in standards mode, avoiding quirks mode and helping with consistent rendering across browsers.

## 🏷️ <html> Element

### 📜 What is the `<html>` Element?

The `<html>` tag is the root element of the HTML document. Everything inside the `<html>` tag is a part of the HTML document.



```html
`<html lang="en">     <!-- Content goes here --> </html>`
```

- **Attributes:**
    - `lang`: Specifies the language of the document (e.g., `lang="en"` for English).

## 🧠 <head> Element

### 📘 What is the `<head>` Element?

The `<head>` section of the HTML document contains meta-information, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other resources that are necessary for the document but not displayed directly on the page.

#### Common Elements in `<head>`:



```html
`<head>     
	<meta charset="UTF-8">     
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>My HTML Document</title>     
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 
</head>`
```
- **Key Elements:**
    - `<title>`: Sets the title shown in the browser tab.
    - `<meta>`: Provides metadata such as character encoding (`charset`), viewport settings for responsive design, and descriptions.
    - `<link>`: Links to external resources like CSS files.
    - `<script>`: Links to external JavaScript files or includes inline scripts.

## 📝 <body> Element

### 🎨 What is the `<body>` Element?

The `<body>` tag encompasses all the content that is visible on the webpage, such as text, images, and other media.


```html
<body>     
	<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>     
	<p>This is an example of a basic HTML document structure.</p> 
</body>`
```
---

## 🔧 Meta Tags (`<meta>`)

### 💡 What are Meta Tags?

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document and are placed within the `<head>` element. They are essential for SEO, accessibility, and ensuring that the document is displayed correctly across different devices.

#### Common Meta Tags:

- **Character Set:**


```html
	`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
```

Defines the character encoding, which is crucial for displaying text correctly.

- **Viewport:**


```html
	`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
```
Controls the layout on mobile browsers, making the page responsive.

- **Description:**


```html
	`<meta name="description" content="This is an example HTML document.">`
```

Provides a description of the webpage, important for search engines.

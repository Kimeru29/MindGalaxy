## Overview

This note provides a detailed look into event handling mechanisms for buttons in WPF. Understanding these events is crucial for creating interactive and responsive applications.

## 🗺️ Button Event Handling

### Click Event
- **Basics**: The `Click` event is the most common event associated with buttons, triggered when the button is clicked.
- **Handling**: In the code-behind, a method is defined and associated with the button’s `Click` event, usually within the XAML or in the constructor of the view.

### Mouse Events
- **MouseEnter/MouseLeave**: Triggered when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the button area.
- **PreviewMouseDown/PreviewMouseUp**: Capture mouse button actions before the `Click` event is raised.

### Focus Events
- **GotFocus/LostFocus**: Occur when the button gains or loses keyboard focus, useful in form navigation and validation scenarios.

### Advanced Event Concepts
- **Routed Events**: Understanding how events bubble up or tunnel down the visual tree, allowing for centralized event handling.
- **Command Binding**: While not a direct event handling method, commands are often used in place of events to invoke logic in the ViewModel.

## 🌟 Event Handling Tips

- **Use of Code-Behind**: While event handlers are often placed in the code-behind, ensure they remain minimal and focused.
- **Event Routing**: Leverage the event routing strategy in WPF to handle events at the appropriate level in your application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI logic separate from business logic as much as possible.

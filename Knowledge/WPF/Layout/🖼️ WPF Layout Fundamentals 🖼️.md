## 🗺️ Key Concepts of WPF Layout

### Layout Process
- **Measure and Arrange**: The two-step process (Measure and Arrange) that WPF uses to render UI elements.
- **Size Determination**: How elements determine their size based on available space and content.

### Basic Layout Controls
- **Panels**: The building blocks for arranging UI elements. Includes `Grid`, `StackPanel`, `WrapPanel`, etc.
- **Grid**: Versatile for complex layouts, divided into rows and columns.
- **StackPanel**: Simple linear arrangement either vertically or horizontally.
- **WrapPanel**: Arranges elements sequentially, wrapping at the edge of its container.

### Sizing and Positioning
- **Width and Height**: How to set fixed, auto, or relative sizes.
- **Margin and Padding**: Adjusting space around and inside elements.
- **Alignment Properties**: `HorizontalAlignment` and `VerticalAlignment` for alignment within parent containers.

### Nested Layouts
- Combining different panels to create complex UI structures.
- Understanding how child elements interact with parent containers.

### Responsive Design
- Making UI adaptable to different window sizes.
- Using `Viewbox` for scaling content.
